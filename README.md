# Overview

Over the summer, I contributed to the development of the Correlation Tensor MRI (CTI) module for DIPY, a novel diffusion MRI technique that enhances the accuracy of characterizing tissue microstructure and mapping complex white matter connections. My work involved creating a CTI design matrix, generating CTI simulations, developing a CTI module, writing rigorous tests, and designing a comprehensive tutorial. This work will help in distinguishing various sources of kurtosis in biological tissues, ultimately aiding in better understanding and analysis of MRI data.

# Acknowledgements

I am immensely grateful to my mentor, Rafael, for his unwavering support, insightful guidance, and remarkable patience throughout this journey. His willingness to answer my numerous questions, no matter how trivial, not only helped me grow as a developer but also gave me invaluable insights into managing and contributing to open-source projects in a way that facilitates the contributions of others. I also extend my heartfelt thanks to the Google Summer of Code team for creating this incredible opportunity to collaborate and learn from talented individuals around the globe.
